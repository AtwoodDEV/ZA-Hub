## Description

**Z.A Hub** is a script/hub/gui whatever you want to call it. I made **Z.A Hub** to remove the grinding and boredome as the progression in the game is hard when you first started playing the game! **Z.A Hub** is for the Roblox game called [Zombie Attack](https://www.roblox.com/games/1240123653/Zombie-Attack). **Z.A Hub** Is currently a small project that I am working on alone!

## Execute
